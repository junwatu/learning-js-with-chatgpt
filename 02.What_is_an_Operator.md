# What is an Operator?

In programming, an operator is a symbol that tells the compiler or interpreter to perform specific mathematical, relational, or logical operations and produce final results. They're special symbols or keywords that denote an operation to be performed with one or more operands.

Here are some categories of operators in programming:

1. **Arithmetic operators:** These perform basic mathematical operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), modulo (%), etc.

2. **Relational operators:** Also known as comparison operators, these compare two values and determine the relation between them. They include less than (<), greater than (>), equal to (==), not equal to (!=), less than or equal to (<=), and greater than or equal to (>=).

3. **Logical operators:** These are used to combine two or more conditions and return true or false depending on whether the conditions are met. Examples are AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!).

4. **Bitwise operators:** These perform operations on binary representations of numbers. They include AND (&), OR (|), NOT (~), XOR (^), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).

5. **Assignment operators:** These are used to assign values to variables. The simple assignment operator is =, but there are also compound assignment operators that perform an operation and assign the result, such as +=, -=, \*=, and /=.

6. **Unary operators:** These operate on a single operand. Examples are increment (++), decrement (--), and logical negation (!).

7. **Ternary operator:** This is a conditional operator that operates on three operands. In languages like C, C++, and Java, it's written as ?:.

8. **Access operators:** These are used to access data from containers (like arrays or objects). Examples include the dot operator (.) for accessing object properties, the array brackets ([]) for accessing array elements, etc.

The specific symbols used for these operators can vary from one programming language to another.

## Unique Features of JavaScript Operators

In JavaScript, most of the operators work the same way as in other C-based languages (like C++, C#, Java, etc.). However, JavaScript has a few unique features in the way it handles operators, largely due to its dynamically-typed nature.

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Type Coercion** | JavaScript performs automatic type conversion, or type coercion, in certain operator contexts. For example, the '+' operator can perform both addition and string concatenation. If you try to add a number to a string, JavaScript will convert the number to a string and concatenate them. Similarly, using comparison operators like '==' can lead to unexpected results due to type coercion. |
| **Strict Equality Operator** | JavaScript introduces the '===' operator (strict equality) and '!==' (strict inequality), which not only check the value but also the type of the two operands. This is to avoid unexpected results due to type coercion when using '==' and '!='. |
| **Double Bitwise NOT (`~~`)** | Double bitwise NOT (`~~`) is often used to replace `Math.floor()`. It works similarly to `Math.floor()` for positive numbers but behaves differently for negative numbers. |
| **Logical Assignment Operators** | JavaScript introduced logical assignment operators `&&=`, `||=`, and`??=` in ES2021. These operators combine logical operations with assignment. |
| **Optional Chaining Operator (`?.`)** | The optional chaining operator (`?.`) allows you to read the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to check that each reference in the chain is valid. |
| **Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)** | The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is null or undefined, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand. |
| **Exponentiation Operator (`**`)** | The exponentiation operator (`**`) is used to raise the first operand to the power of the second operand. This is not present in some other languages, which would typically use `Math.pow()` or similar functions for exponentiation. |

Please remember that the implementation of these operators might change as the JavaScript standard (ECMAScript) evolves.

Please remember that these operators should be used in accordance with the operand types that they're expected to work with, and the exact behavior of some operators might differ based on the type of the operands.

## Understanding the typeof Operator

The `typeof` operator in JavaScript is used to determine the data type of a given operand. Here's its general syntax:

```javascript
typeof operand
```

`operand` is the string, variable, keyword, or object for which the type is to be returned. The parentheses are optional.

The `typeof` operator can return the following types:

- `"number"`: if the operand is a number.
- `"string"`: if the operand is a string.
- `"boolean"`: if the operand is a boolean.
- `"undefined"`: if the operand is undefined.
- `"object"`: if the operand is an object or `null`. This can be a point of confusion because `null` is considered a primitive value in JavaScript, but `typeof null` returns `"object"`.
- `"function"`: if the operand is a function.
- `"symbol"`: if the operand is a symbol.
- `"bigint"`: if the operand is a BigInt.

For example:

```javascript
console.log(typeof 10); // Output: "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // Output: "string"
console.log(typeof true); // Output: "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefinedVariable); // Output: "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // Output: "object"
console.log(typeof function(){}); // Output: "function"
console.log(typeof Symbol("id")); // Output: "symbol"
console.log(typeof 123n); // Output: "bigint"
```

In comparison to some other languages, JavaScript's `typeof` operator is a bit unique because JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language. This operator enables developers to determine the type of a value at runtime.

### typeof vs instanceof

`typeof` and `instanceof` are both operators in JavaScript, but they are used for different purposes.

`typeof` is a unary operator that returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.

```javascript
console.log(typeof 'Hello'); // "string"
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof true); // "boolean"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
console.log(typeof null); // "object"  (this is considered a bug in JavaScript)
console.log(typeof {a: 1}); // "object"
console.log(typeof [1, 2, 3]); // "object"
console.log(typeof function(){}); // "function"
```

`instanceof`, on the other hand, is a binary operator used to check the prototype chain of an object. It checks if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. The return value is a boolean value.

```javascript
class MyClass {}

const instance = new MyClass();

console.log(instance instanceof MyClass); // true
console.log(instance instanceof Object); // true
console.log(instance instanceof Array); // false
```

In other words, `typeof` tells you what type of primitive or built-in type a variable is, while `instanceof` tells you if an object is an instance of a certain class or constructor function, checking up the prototype chain.

## Interaction of JavaScript Operators with Hardware

*On hardware POV is there any special instruction that correlated to operator?*

Yes, from a hardware perspective, operators in high-level languages like JavaScript often map to specific machine instructions at the assembly level. This is because, at the lowest level, computers execute machine code, which includes instructions for various operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise operations, logical operations, shifting, and more.

For example, when you use the `+` operator in JavaScript to add two numbers, this operation will eventually be translated by a JavaScript engine (like V8 for Chrome) into machine instructions that perform the addition operation. This might be an `ADD` instruction on an x86 processor, or a similar instruction on another type of processor.

The exact mapping of high-level operations to low-level instructions can vary depending on the specific CPU architecture (x86, ARM, etc.), the specific model of the CPU, and the implementation of the JavaScript engine.

It's important to note, however, that the mapping from high-level JavaScript operators to low-level machine instructions is not direct or straightforward. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted language, and JavaScript engines use sophisticated techniques such as just-in-time compilation and various optimization strategies to execute JavaScript code efficiently. For example, the V8 engine in Chrome compiles JavaScript to an intermediate bytecode, which is then interpreted by a bytecode interpreter or further compiled to machine code, depending on various factors.

In addition, some JavaScript operations might not have a direct equivalent at the hardware level. For example, operations involving JavaScript's dynamic typing, object model, and garbage collection system involve complex high-level logic that does not correspond directly to simple hardware instructions.
